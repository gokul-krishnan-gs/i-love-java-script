Hi 👋 This repository documents my JavaScript learning journey, including concepts, practice programs, experiments, and small implementations that I worked on while learning JavaScript.

The goal of this repo is to build strong JavaScript fundamentals, understand how things work internally, and improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## 📚 What's Inside

* ✅ **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions.
* 🚀 **Advanced JavaScript Concepts** - Scope, closures, hoisting, callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop.
* 🌐 **DOM Manipulation & Browser APIs** - Events, form handling, localStorage, and interaction with the browser.
* 🧠 **Problem-Solving Programs** - Logic-based problems, algorithmic exercises, and optimized solutions.
* 🧪 **Experiments & Mini Demos** - Small experiments to understand JavaScript behavior, edge cases, and internal mechanics.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Build a strong JavaScript foundation
* Improve problem-solving and debugging skills
* Prepare for React, Node.js, and TypeScript
* Maintain a personal reference for revision and future projects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Browser APIs
* VS Code

## 👨‍💻 Who This Repo Is For

* Beginners learning JavaScript
* Developers revising core concepts
* Anyone curious about how JavaScript works internally

## 📌 Note

This repository is continuously updated as I learn new concepts and explore JavaScript deeper.
